Hummingbot MCP Quick Checks

These are optional interactive checks via Codex CLI after `docs/mcp_setup.md` is configured.

Example prompts
```
Show me my portfolio balances.
What are my open positions?
List active orders on binance_perpetual.
Get recent funding rates for BTC-USDT.
```

Operational notes
- MCP is for manual inspection and ad-hoc actions.
- The autonomous bot still runs via direct REST calls.
